I’m a Software engineer at heart. I love building software that makes the lives of people easier.

I have 7 years of experience in the software industry working in both B2B and B2C setups.

From starting as a Web Developer and building web applications using Zend Framework, MySQL and Elasticsearch, I have come a long way to building web applications and backend systems for India’ largest ticketing company, BookMyShow. For the past 1 year, I am working at Amazon India as a Data Engineer.

I have experience in building scalable web applications, big data pipelines and real-time messaging applications.
